My research lie in the interface of syntax/semantics/pragmatics using a blend of cross-linguistic, theoretical, and empirical methods. My doctoral dissertation concerns locative inversion in Mandarin Chinese, with a particular focus on the question of 

- how to characterise the semantic relationship between locative inversion and the uninverted construction, 
- what motivates the choice of locative inversion over its alternative construction, and 
- what characterise the verbs found in locative inversion. 

I am also interested in

* existential construction (存现句), spatial semantics of place and path (空间语义学)
* focus particles (副词), numerals and classifiers (数量结构)
* corpus linguistics, historical linguistics
