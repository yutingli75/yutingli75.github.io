My academic journey began in Hunan, China, where I studied Chinese, English, and general linguistics, and continued in Berlin, Germany, and Shanghai, China, where I shifted toward conducting empirical investigations and applying statistical techniques to language analysis. 

I am driven by a desire to understand what determines or predicts a linguistic form that speakers tend to express within the context of linguistic variants, which are alternative ways of saying ‘the same’ thing. A case in point is the phenomenon of locative inversion, where the sentence <i>An old woman lives in the woods</i> can be conveyed by the variant <i>In the woods lives an old woman</i>, which is semantically and/or functionally near equivalent.
